    "This pipeline cannot be run without a project-specific design file created by the analyst.  Create such a file for this project, following the guidance shown below (excerpted from the cirrus-ngs README):\n",
    "\n",
    "The design file is a tab-separated text file that specifies the names of the sequence files to process.  It has no header line.  For miRNA-Seq, it must contain two columns but only the first column is actively used by the pipeline. The **first column** is the filename of the sample (with extensions: e.g. fastq.gz), as shown below in examples modified from the cirrus README:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For example, a two-column design file for two single-end-sequenced samples named `mysample1` and `mysample2` might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\tmysample1.fastq.gz\t\tnot_applicable\n",
    "\tmysample2.fastq.gz\t\tnot_applicable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ">If the sequencing data is paired-end, the first column includes the name of the forward sequencing file, followed by a comma, followed by the name of the reverse sequencing file (note that there must **not** be any spaces between these two file names--only a comma!)  An example two-column design file for two paired-end-sequenced samples named `mysample1` and `mysample2` might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\tmysample1_fwd.fastq.gz,mysample1_rev.fastq.gz\t\tnot_applicable\n",
    "\tmysample2_fwd.fastq.gz,mysample2_rev.fastq.gz\t\tnot_applicable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that **second column** must have content but is not actively used by the pipeline, so best practice is to set all values of that column to \"not_applicable\".\n",
